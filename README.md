# Restaurant-Analysis

A Web application developed using Django for helping people who wish to open new food outlets, decide cruicial factors like price and rating of the outlet.
The user needs to provide information about the outlet like cuisines available, highlights, operating time etc. and chose whether to predict what avg. cost per head
it should keep for the desired rating, or predict rating based on the desired avg. cost.
The application uses a Deep Neural Network model, trained on over 220,000 restaurant's data across India, in order to predict the desired target output. The model achieved around 87% accuracy and is pretty reliable
